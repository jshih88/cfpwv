# Age-Specific Analysis of Childhood Cognitive Ability and Cardiovascular Risk Factors

## Age 9 Analysis

### Overview
At age 9, 11 cardiovascular risk factors were measured. Of these, 2 (18.2%) showed a statistically significant association with childhood IQ measured at age 8.

### Direction of Associations
- Negative associations (higher IQ, lower risk factor): 9
- Positive associations (higher IQ, higher risk factor): 1

### Strongest Associations
The strongest association was with Body Mass Index (coefficient = -0.0349, p = 0.0090).
